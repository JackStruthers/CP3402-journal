# Week 7
## Learning Activities
This week I spent time learning how to use PHP in a bit more depth. This included learning how to use basic functions in PHP. This included how to create a function, included sperate PHP pages on a main page, use loops, echo text, and have decisions.

## Estimated hours
I spent about 3 learning about these topics.

## Content Insights
With this I had the great idea of making a while loop that would count how many seconds the user has been on the page. I then found out quickly that this was not going to work. This loop would instead force my webpage to take ages to load and fill it with messages about the time. I was not able to find a way around this so instead just took out the line that included it on my index. I then tried to get a function to count how many times a button had pressed and use that value to tell the user how many times they had pressed the button. This function would not count how many times it had been pressed, and I am not sure why. I did however get the header and footer to work using the include function in PHP which was nice. I also got an if statement that greets the user differently depending on the time of day.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
PHP is great tool for creating dynamic website. PHP lets you create reusable code that you can add to your standard webpages. This allows you to more quickly and consistently make webpages that have the same style and layout while still having the flexibility for you to add depending on the needs of the page.
