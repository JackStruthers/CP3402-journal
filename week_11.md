# Week 11
## Learning Activities
This week learning ways to warm up my voice and look more confident and comfortable when presenting to the camera. I read some articles and learnt about not closing my body up and keeping eye contact with camera. These activities were done to help with the presentation that is coming up. I also spent time looking into how to make a wordpress site more secure.

## Estimated hours
I spent about 3.5 hours learning and practicing these topics.

From this I learnt that by warming your voice up you can improve the way you sound and can help maintain a consistent tone. By running through some of the exercises in the second link I found my flow was much better.    
I also learnt that by keeping an open posture (not crossing my arms) I come across as more confident in what I am saying. Using gestures also helps with building more confidence. I did find, when I started using gestures and opened my posture, I was feeling more confident in what I had to say.  
When it came to security there are a lot of common sense steps to take such as having a specific amount of login attempts and having a strong password. However there were a few things I did not really take into account such as hiding your wordpress version so it is harder for intruder to know what possible back doors may work.  
I was also unsure as to why automatic logouts are so common, I initially thought it was to take some pressure off of the servers. However it is to help prevent an attacker hijacking the session which can lead to unwanted outcomes to the site.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
These techniques are very useful for whenever I may have to present in my life. These techniques help not only with recordings of myself but also in front of people. These practices also help me in my current sales role as by seeming more confident it can help customers trust me more as they feel they can trust what I am saying more.  
The security side has also helped teach me what is important to do to help protect a clients website. Taking all the obvious precautions and maybe some that are not are very important to proctect the business and the clients. If the clients do have issues and it was preventable there is a good chance they could look for someone else to do the job which is obviously bad for me.
