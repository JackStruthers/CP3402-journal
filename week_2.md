# Week 2
## Learning Activities
This week my focus was learning how to use Joomla. I went through learning how to add pages, articles logos and a small experiment with an extension.

## Resources and Links
I did most of learning through experimentation. I learnt by doing this week and did not really look anything up.

## Estimated hours
I spent about 3 hours learning the basics of how to build up the website.

## Content Insights
This week taught me how to create a simple website using a CMS. I got to properly see how a dynamic website is built. This also taught me how useful a CMS is when it comes to a website you are going to frequently update it. Having never worked with one I was impressed with just how easy it was to use. It is really easy to add lots of content quickly and not having to redesign a whole page to add a new article is very nice.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
With this new knowledge on how a CMS works it will be super useful for the future when it comes to designing websites. Building a blog style website or just one that is frequently updated is very doable and so much easier with a CMS. I can also use this for myself personally should I ever want to host a personal website for any content I feel like creating.
