# Week 6
## Learning Activities
This week I spent time setting up underscores then decided to move towards Understrap as it has more tutorials that are much more recent and up to date. I learnt how to use Node.js to compile my SASS into CSS when using Understrap as well. I also look at how to use Browsersync as another possible option. Browsersync automates updating my websites look while I change SASS to save me time by not having to reload my browser.

## Estimated hours
I spent about an hour and half learning about these topics.

## Content Insights
When I was trying to use underscores I found myself lost and not being able to make a start on anything for hours. I did not really find much useful stuff online for underscores that was up to date, making it harder to try and learn. My team member, Kazuki, then sent me some Understrap resources. The Understrap resources are more up to date and I personally find it easier to follow. This might be what the team uses to develop our website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This experience of wasting almost a day trying to get something to work that I should instead look around for other possible solutions. Sometimes one technique just does work for me and instead of getting frustrated I should see if there is another possible way to get around my roadblocks.
