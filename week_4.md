## Estimated hours
I spent about 2 and half hours experimenting with a couple of ways to host before settling on WAMP

## Content Insights
Originally I wanted to use Docker but when I attempted to use this it would ping a virus and could not be installed so I could not use it at all. Then when I tried vagrant the website I used did not really do a good job of explaing how to use it so I moved onto WAMP. WAMP I found to be a great tool for a developer working on website. It was easy to set up and control and gave me a good idea on how to begin hosting a website. By creating websites locally it lets me do much more testing and experimenting without compromising the active website. Wordpress also makes it really easy to export and import websites so testing is easy and only takes a few clicks to update the live site.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
For a future career this has shown me the importance of developing on a local host. If I were to not do this and were building a website for a client any potential downtime is money that they are losing. By extenstion I would lose money as well, they would not pay for my services if I were incompentent. Using this method is a great way to test for errors and experiment.
