## Estimated hours
I spent about 3 and half hours learning the basics of how to build up the website.

## Content Insights
This week was spent learning how to set up a new kind of CMS. I have found that wordpress seems to give me more flexability with what I want to do when compared to Joomla. I believe this as I found that the block system in Wordpress really lets you experiment with different styles very quickly. The GUI Wordpress has when actually building a page also feels more intuative as you can easily see how everything is going to look as you edit the page.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This has really shown me why Wordpress is the most use CMS for websites on the internet. You do not need a lot of experience when it comes making a website that looks okay. This has taught me that if I am to practice a CMS wordpress should be the one I focus most of my time to. It is an industry leader and is still constantly being updated to have new features constantly.
