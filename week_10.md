This week learning ways to warm up my voice and look more confident and comfortable when presenting to the camera. I read some articles and learnt about not closing my body up and keeping eye contact with camera. These activities were done to help with the presentation that is coming up.

## Estimated hours
I spent about 2.5 hours learning and practicing these topics.

## Content Insights
From this I learnt that by warming your voice up you can improve the way you sound and can help maintain a consistent tone. By running through some of the exercises in the second link I found my flow was much better.    
I also learnt that by keeping an open posture (not crossing my arms) I come across as more confident in what I am saying. Using gestures also helps with building more confidence. I did find, when I started using gestures and opened my posture, I was feeling more confident in what I had to say.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
These techniques are very useful for whenever I may have to present in my life. These techniques help not only with recordings of myself but also in front of people. These practices also help me in my current sales role as by seeming more confident it can help customers trust me more as they feel they can trust what I am saying more.
