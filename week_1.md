# Week 1
## Learning Activities
This week I decided to make my website using HTML and CSS to refresh myself on how to do things instead of using bootstrap. I also had a look at a couple of options for web hosting but have not picked one yet.


## Resources and Links
https://www.w3schools.com
https://aws.amazon.com
https://www.digitalocean.com


## Estimated hours
I spent about 5 hours outside of class reading up on some hosting options and finilising my website

## Content Insights
From this I learnt that there are quite a few different potential places to host my website, each with some pros and cons. Amazon seems like the best bet at the moment due to how flexible it is but digital ocean does also look to be a bit more user friendly. I did not really learn anything to new when it came to HTML or CSS however it was good to refresh myself on how to use both.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Being able to relearn a topic pretty quickly is something that I find I am good at and redoing some of the HTML and CSS practices I did this week have helped me reinforce how to learn fast. By actually doing the task at hand and not just reading a website or watching something. If I give something a go first and then use resources to help refine or teach me things I have forgotten I find I hold onto topics much better than just trying to refresh myself by reading. It stops me from just looking at it and saying to myself I already know this and challenges me to find what I do an do not know.
