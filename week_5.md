# Week 5
## Learning Activities
This week I spent time watching two different tutorials and reading up on the child theme documentation on the WordPress website. I started by watching the LinkedIn video and while it was outdated it still had some good information that was useable. I then stumbled upon the YouTube video that showed me a plugin for WordPress that quickly lets you create a child theme. Using this plugin, I then started on editing my child theme in Visual studio code with to make the visual changes required with CSS.

## Estimated hours
I spent about 3 and hours with videos and testing child themes.

## Content Insights
Initially I followed the WordPress Documentation on setting up a child theme which for some reason would not work. Looking back at why it would not work I may have missed a line while setting it up, but I cannot be sure. I then watched the LinkedIn video which was good as I managed to properly set up the folder and needed CSS file to go along with this. However, I did find this a little long winded and decided to see if there were any other possible solutions. I found it long winded just due to the aspects of it that were not really required for this practical but will be helpful later. I went to YouTube where I found out there was a plugin that allows you to pick the theme you wish to make a child for, and it creates the needed files for it. Using this I quickly had the PHP and CSS required to start editing my child theme visually.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This experience has taught me that looking for plugins to achieve something on your website is always a good idea. This is because it can save me as the developer time when it comes to setting up repetitive things, such as child themes, functions on a website. These time savers give me more time to focus on the parts of the website that do require a bit more attention such as styling the website.
